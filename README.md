# Apogee Forever

Five focused addons for **World of Warcraft Forever 1.60.1**:

- **Heals:** party frames, click healing and buff reminders.
- **Keybinds:** configurable keyboard and mouse actions with combat HUDs.
- **Group Alert:** dungeon group discovery and recruitment alerts.
- **Essentials:** chat conveniences, UI fading and error controls.
- **Stats:** role-aware gear guidance with NEED during loot rolls and UPGRADE on other item tooltips.

Tank and the standalone Auction addon are retired from both package families.

Enable the modules you want under **Apogee Forever** in WoW's AddOns list.
Gameplay modules retain their own settings. Stats evaluates all supported roles outdoors and uses your assigned role or instance fallback in dungeons. Its character-window Gear filter applies only while that window is open. This edition supports Forever only.

Legacy profiles are not imported, and Dungeon Guide is not included.

Install using the [CurseForge listing](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/apogee-party-health-bars)
or a packaged [GitHub release](https://github.com/notify353/ApogeeForever/releases).
For a manual installation, extract all six addon folders into Interface/AddOns.
GitHub source archives are not installable packages.

For work across the five addons, use the sibling
[Apogee workspace](../workspace-apogee/README.md) and its
[current handoff](../workspace-apogee/memory/CURRENT.md). These are local sibling
links; the workspace has separate publication status. Distribution authority
remains in this repository.

Stats auction browsing: click the left-side dice to enable upgrade filtering.
Then optionally narrow by Max gold and role (All roles by default). Dice off
restores normal native results. Select best requires a specific native equipment
slot, one role/playstyle, and complete checks; the status explains missing choices.
Click it to select a freshly verified buyout. Buying remains manual. Each visit
starts off with no gold cap and All roles; native filter preferences are preserved.
